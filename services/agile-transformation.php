                    The Agile Transformation Center is not a one-stop shop for all of your agile needs. For 
                    high-quality software delivery in our major business areas, we depend on agile
                    development approaches that have been proven again and again. Our Agile 
                    Transformation Methodology is constantly developing as a result of our extensive 
                    experience in the development services industry.<br><br>
                    The establishment of our Agile Transformation practice was prompted by client 
                    requirements. The Agile Transformation Initiative, which we provides, was requested by 
                    clients after they were impressed by the efficiency and quality that we supplied via its 
                    agile development technique.<br><br>
                    When implementing agile transformation, collaborative our-client teams may convert 
                    while still in operation, resulting in the least amount of service disruption and deterioration. 
                    Agile Transition Services and Agile Development Services work hand in hand to ensure 
                    that a transformation is successful and continues to function over an extended period of 
                    time.</p>
