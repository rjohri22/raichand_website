                        among the clients with whom we collaborate. Boardroom trends and best practises are 
                        incorporated into our local understanding of governance norms and legislation, as well as 
                        our global perspective on corporate governance, to provide a comprehensive picture of 
                        the state of the boardroom.<br><br>
                        A good example of our extensive research and thought leadership on board-related 
                        issues is the Spencer Stuart Board Index and Point of View. These two studies are among 
                        our most well-known studies on corporate governance and represent two of our most 
                        well-known studies on corporate governance.<br><br>
                        Parmi other things, we have experience in counselling boards as well as advising boards 
                        on board composition and compensation.
